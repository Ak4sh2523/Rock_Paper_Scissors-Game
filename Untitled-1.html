      <p class="ruless">Objective:<br> The objective of the game is to defeat your opponent by selecting a weapon that defeats their choice.<br><br>
        Weapon Choices:<br> There are three possible choices: Rock, Paper, and Scissors.
        Rock defeats Scissors (Rock crushes Scissors)
        Scissors defeats Paper (Scissors cut Paper)
        Paper defeats Rock (Paper covers Rock).<br><br>
        Gameplay:<br> Players select one of the three weapons simultaneously and reveal their choices at the same time.<br><br>
        Outcome:<br> The outcome is determined based on the interaction between the chosen weapons:
        If both players choose the same weapon, the game is a tie.
        Otherwise, the player who chose the winning weapon (based on the rules above) wins the round.</p>
